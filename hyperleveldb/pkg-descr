HyperLevelDB is the data storage engine that powers HyperDex.
We forked HyperLevelDB from Google's LevelDB and adapted it to more closely
meet the needs of HyperDex.

HyperLevelDB improves on LevelDB in two key ways:

1: Improved parallelism: HyperLevelDB uses more fine-grained locking internally
to provide higher throughput for multiple writer threads.
2: Improved compaction: HyperLevelDB uses a different method of compaction that
achieves higher throughput for write-heavy workloads, even as the database
grows.
