I'm a lumberjack and I'm ok! I sleep when idle, then I ship logs all day!
I parse your logs, I eat the JVM agent for lunch!

(This project was recently renamed from 'lumberjack' to 'logstash-forwarder' to
make its intended use clear. The 'lumberjack' name now remains as the network
protocol, and 'logstash-forwarder' is the name of the program. It's still the
same lovely log forwarding program you love.)
